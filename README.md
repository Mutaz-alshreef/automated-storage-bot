# 🤖 Automated Food Storage Robot

## 🧠 Project Goal
Design and implement a robot to convert a traditional food storage warehouse into a fully automated warehouse — without human intervention.

---

## ✅ Tasks

- ✅ Write the robot's execution algorithm
- ✅ Design the robot
- ✅ Define the **Working Envelope** elements

---

## 🧩 1. Execution Algorithm

1. **Initialize System**
   - Power on all modules (sensors, motors, controllers)
   - Perform system checks (battery, connectivity)

2. **Scan and Map Warehouse**
   - Use ultrasonic or LiDAR sensors to detect layout
   - Map shelves, inventory stations, and obstacles

3. **Receive Commands**
   - Connect to the central database or controller
   - Receive order: item location, destination

4. **Navigate to Item**
   - Plan path using pathfinding algorithm (e.g., A*)
   - Avoid obstacles using IR/ultrasonic sensors

5. **Pick Item**
   - Position robot arm precisely
   - Activate gripper or vacuum to pick item

6. **Deliver Item**
   - Navigate to output station or delivery zone
   - Release item securely

7. **Return to Standby Position**
   - Return to charging or idle zone
   - Wait for next command

## 🛠️ 2. Robot Design Overview

| Component         | Description                                                   |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Chassis**       | Mobile base with wheels/tracks to navigate the warehouse      |
| **Motors**        | DC or Stepper motors for precise movement                     |
| **Arm/Actuator**  | Multi-joint robotic arm for picking/storing food items        |
| **Gripper**       | Adaptive gripper or vacuum-based end effector                 |
| **Controller**    | Arduino / Raspberry Pi / ESP32 for robot control              |
| **Sensors**       | Ultrasonic, IR, proximity sensors for navigation and detection|
| **Camera**        | (Optional) For visual feedback or object detection            |
| **Power Supply**  | Battery with safety circuit (e.g., LiPo + BMS)                |
| **Communication** | Wi-Fi / Bluetooth / RF module for control and updates        |

## 🧭 3. Working Envelope Elements

- **X-Axis Range**: Distance the robot can move forward/backward in the warehouse  
- **Y-Axis Range**: Side-to-side mobility within aisles or shelves  
- **Z-Axis Range**: Vertical reach of the robotic arm (for picking from high shelves)  
- **Arm Degrees of Freedom (DoF)**: Number of joints/movements the arm can perform  
- **Rotation Limits**: Angular movement boundaries of joints  
- **Workspace Limits**: Physical size limits where the robot can safely operate  
- **Obstacle Zones**: Areas robot must avoid (walls, human pathways)

---

## 📌 Notes

- Ensure safety mechanisms are implemented to stop the robot in emergencies.
- The robot should operate under various lighting and temperature conditions.
- Consider real-time feedback (e.g., sensors, cameras) for adjusting motion dynamically.

## 📷 Optional: Add a diagram or simulation
> You can use tools like **TinkerCAD**, **SolidWorks**, or **Fusion 360** to create the 3D design.
